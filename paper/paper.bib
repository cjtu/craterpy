  abstract = {The volcanic parent rock (``protolith'') composing the lunar maria is likely to have developed diverse mechanical properties upon emplacement. The abundance of rocks ejected by impacts may be sensitive to protolith properties. We investigate the relationship between the possible diversity of mare protoliths and the abundance of rocks excavated and emplaced by impacts employing cumulative size-frequency distributions (SFDs) of rocky craters in the maria. The SFDs of 15 mare units were calculated through varying degrees of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Diviner-derived rock abundance within crater ejecta blankets. By inspecting the frequency of high rock abundance craters, we find that the age of a surface does not control an impactor's ability to excavate rocks. Through analysis of SFDs, we find that differences in SFD behavior may act as probes for the mechanical strength of the protolith and the thickness of buried lava flows. Generally, regions with SFDs that have shallower slopes with increasing rockiness may be associated with thick, competent flow types, and regions with SFDs that have unchanging slopes with increasing rockiness may be associated with stacked, thin flows that are possibly more friable. The greater frequency of high rock abundance craters and the converging behavior of SFDs at two units within Mare Humorum and Oceanus Procellarum suggest that the surfaces are underlain by thick, competent lava flows. Finally, SFD slope analysis suggests that secondary impact craters are relatively ineffective at excavating rocks and the SFDs of rocky craters may reflect primary cratering populations.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) offer promising opportunities to automatically glean scientifically relevant information directly from annotated images, without needing to handcraft features for detection. Crater counting started with hand counting hundreds, thousands, or even millions of craters in order to determine the age of geological units on planetary bodies of the solar system. Automated crater detection algorithms have attempted to speed up this process. Previous research has employed computer vision techniques with handcrafted features such as light and shadow patterns, circle finding, or edge detection. This research continues, but now some researchers use techniques like convolutional neural networks that enable the algorithm to develop its own features. As the field of machine learning undergoes exponential growth in terms of paper count and research methods, the crater counting application can benefit from the new research, especially when conducting joint interdisciplinary projects. Despite these advancements, the crater counting community has not yet adopted standard methods for automating the process despite decades of research. This survey enumerates challenges for both planetary geologists and machine learning researchers, looks at the recent automatic crater detection advancements using machine learning techniques (primarily in methods using CNNs), and makes recommendations for the path toward greater automation.},

  abstract = {The impact crater detection offers a great scientific contribution in analyzing the geological processes, morphologies and physical properties of the celestial bodies and plays a crucial role in potential future landing sites. The huge amount of craters requires automated detection algorithms, and considering the low spatial resolution provided by the satellite jointly with, the solar illuminance/incidence variety, these methods lack their performance in the recognition tasks. Furthermore, small craters are harder to recognize also by human experts and the need to have a sophisticated detection algorithm becomes mandatory. To address these problems, we propose a deep learning architecture refers as ``YOLOLens5x'', for impact crater detection based on super-resolution in a unique end-to-end design. We introduce the entire workflow useful to link the Robbins Lunar catalogue with the tiles orthoprojected from the Lunar mosaic LROC mission in order to train our proposed model as a supervised paradigm and, the various optimization due to provide a clear dataset in the training step. We prove by experimental results a boost in terms of precision and recall than the other state-of-the-art crater detection models, reporting the lowest error estimated craters diameter using the same scale factor given by LROC WAC Camera. To simulate the camera satellite at the lowest spatial resolution, we carried out experiments at different scale factors (200 m/px, 400 m/px) by interpolating the source image of 100 m/px, bringing to light remarkable results across all metrics under consideration compared with the baseline used.},

  abstract = {Crater counting on the Moon and other bodies is crucial to constrain the dynamical history of the Solar System. This has traditionally been done by visual inspection of images, thus limiting the scope, efficiency, and/or accuracy of retrieval. In this paper we demonstrate the viability of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the positions and sizes of craters from Lunar digital elevation maps (DEMs). We recover 92\% of craters from the human-generated test set and almost double the total number of crater detections. Of these new craters, 15\% are smaller in diameter than the minimum crater size in the ground-truth dataset. Our median fractional longitude, latitude and radius errors are 11\% or less, representing good agreement with the human-generated datasets. From a manual inspection of 361 new craters we estimate the false positive rate of new craters to be 11\%. Moreover, our Moon-trained CNN performs well when tested on DEM images of Mercury, detecting a large fraction of craters in each map. Our results suggest that deep learning will be a useful tool for rapidly and automatically extracting craters on various Solar System bodies. We make our code and data publicly available at https://github.com/silburt/DeepMoon.git and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1133969.},

  abstract = {Space weathering processes form submicroscopic metallic iron particles that are optically active, darkening and reddening the lunar surface over time. The optical effects of these particles depend on their size; nanophase iron darkens and reddens, while microphase iron darkens without reddening. Using available Kaguya Multiband Imager parameter maps believed to estimate submicroscopic iron abundance, we investigate trends that may be associated with abundance of nanophase and microphase iron near dated lunar craters. We observe that nanophase iron is strongly correlated with crater age, while microphase iron exhibits a weaker correlation. We present models for the highlands nanophase and microphase iron accumulation rates from 100 ka to 1 Ga. Our observations suggest that highlands nanophase iron abundance is a direct result of space weathering exposure, while highlands microphase iron abundance is likely influenced by lunar source materials or stochastic impact-delivery mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Impact craters are common surface features on planetary surfaces. Their distribution offers important clues regarding geological and temporal processes on the Moon. Numerous endeavors have generated global catalogs of lunar craters; however, most of the existing catalogs only contain large craters (larger than several kilometers in diameter), and none of them offer three-dimensional (3D) morphometric information. In this study, we first present a machine-learning approach for automatic crater detection from digital elevation models (DEMs). Our crater detection approach can achieve a detection rate of about 85\%. We also present an approach for extracting 3D morphometric information of craters based on the topography. These approaches were applied to producing a global crater data set covering the entire lunar surface that includes approximately 1.32 million craters ({$\geq$}1 km). Verification was performed against previously published catalogs (Head et al., 2010, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1195050; Robbins, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018je005592), with about 23\% of our craters transferred from the previous catalogs after a rim-fitting process. The crater catalog includes 3D morphometric data on the craters such as depths. Global analyses of craters based on this improved catalog indicate that the lunar mare and highlands have distinctive crater density differences of small craters (1--5 km). Craters of 2.5--5 km have reached saturation in several local regions in the highlands. Small craters (1--5 km) on the lunar mare are deeper than those on the highlands. The data in our comprehensive crater catalog can support various other lunar scientific studies.},
